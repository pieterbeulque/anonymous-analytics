# ðŸ‘€ Anonymous Analytics ðŸ‘€

> Are you sure you need to use Google Analytics? Consider [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) or [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.io/) as an alternative!

There's a way to use Google's [analytics.js](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/) script in a GDPR- and cookie-friendly manner.

This script loads Google Analytics for you. It then disables all cookies set by Google Analytics & enables the IP anonymization built into GA. The unique client ID is generated by [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) and stored in local storage using [storee](https://github.com/pieterbeulque/storee) (if available) or in the history state object using [histore](https://github.com/developit/histore).

Because you're now using a first party method instead of a third party cookie to track your user across their session, you might be able to get away without the dreaded cookie bar.

The `ga` object is still exposed on `window`, so you can still do any other event tracking. Be careful to keep your GDPR-compliance if you do so. There is currently no option to rename the `ga` global.

## Usage

```html
<script src="anonymous-analytics.js"></script>
<script>
    window.anonymousAnalytics('UA-XXXXXX-XX');
</script>
```

## Browser support

It works on every modern browser and has been tested in IE11. I don't see any reason why it should not work in any older versions of Internet Explorer, but I haven't tested it thoroughly.
